# Bitbucket CLI
This bitbucket CLI tool is a simple and minimal helper to interact with Bitbucket via its public API. 

In all honesty, at the moment you can only create PRs with it ✌️but... who knows :)

**Motivation**
I needed a simple way to create PRs via our Bitbucket Pipelines Scripts and therefore I just created this super simple CLI tool.
We use the public docker image to easily integrate it to our Pipelines so feel free.

## Some details about testing
There are no tests as this is just a simple mini pet project including just a few lines of code.

## Security
We're using simple BASIC auth and no sophisticated OAuth stuff here just to warn you :)

## How to use it
The recommended way is to use the (again, very simple) docker image to run a command.

```sh
docker run sebric/bitbucket-cli:latest {COMMAND_NAME} --help
```

Nevertheless, there might be a outdated version at npm also.
```sh
npm install --global bitbucket-cli
bitbucket-cli --version
```
